title: Coconut Pumpkin Soup
---
Roasting your own pumpkin might sound like extra work but for this fall soup it is 100% worth it. Using fresh pumpkin will make your soup stand out above the rest and the coconut milk will make it extra decadent and comforting.

## Ingredients
-   1 small pumpkin, peeled and cut into 1" pieces
-   1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1" pieces
-   6 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
-   Kosher salt
-   McCormick Black Pepper
-   1 medium onion, chopped
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   2 carrots, thinly sliced
-   2" piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
-   1 tsp. ground coriander
-   1 tsp. paprika
-   1 (13.66-oz.) can Thai Kitchen Unsweetened Coconut Milk
-   4 c. low-sodium vegetable broth
-   1/2 c. pepita seeds
-   2 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley

## Directions
1.  Preheat oven to 425°.

    On a large baking sheet, toss pumpkin and sweet potato with 2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon McCormick black pepper.

    Roast until fork tender, 40 to 45 minutes.

2.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-low heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add onion and cook until soft, 5 minutes.

    Add garlic, carrots, ginger, coriander, paprika, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook until tender, about 8 minutes.

    Add coconut milk and broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.

3.  In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil.

    When oil is shimmering, add pepitas.

    Toast until golden.

    Remove from heat, then stir in parsley, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon black pepper.

4.  Working in two batches, pulse soup base and roasted vegetables in a blender until smooth.

5.  Garnish with toasted pepita mixture before serving.
