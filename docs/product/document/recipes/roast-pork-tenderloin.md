A roasted pork tenderloin meets a mouth watering maple rosemary glaze and it's a match made in heaven. And there are no words for how good the potatoes are.

## Ingredients
-   Kosher salt
-   Freshly ground black pepper
-   2 lb. baby potatoes, quartered
-   1/2 c. plus tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
-   1/4 c. maple syrup
-   3 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 tbsp. whole grain mustard
-   2 tsp. freshly chopped rosemary, plus more for garnish
-   1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes

## Directions
1.  Preheat oven to 400°. Season tenderloin on both sides with salt and pepper.

    Place potatoes in a 9”-x-13” baking dish and drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper.

    Place tenderloin on top.

2.  In a small bowl, whisk together remaining ½ cup oil, maple syrup, garlic, mustard, rosemary, and red pepper flakes.

    Season with salt and pepper then brush over tenderloin.

3.  Roast for 1 hour or until potatoes are tender and tenderloin is cooked through. Internal temperature should read 145°.

4.  Garnish with more rosemary to serve.
